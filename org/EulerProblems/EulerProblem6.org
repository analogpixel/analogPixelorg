* Problem
  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

  12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

* Solution
** Clojure
   #+begin_src clojure
   (-  (#(* % %) (reduce + (range 1 101))) (reduce + (map #(* % %) (range 1 101) )))
   #+end_src

** Python
   #+begin_src clojure
   t1 = 0
   t2 = 0
   for i in range(1,101):
       t1 = t1 + (i*i)
       t2 = t2 + i

   print  (t2 *t2) - t1
   #+end_src


* Non Programming Solution
  $$(1 + 2 + ... + n)^2 = n^2 * (n+1)^2 * 1/4$$

  $$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = n * (n+1) * (2n+1) * 1/6$$

  Sum of first n numbers = n(n+1)/2
  Sum of squares of first n numbers = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
