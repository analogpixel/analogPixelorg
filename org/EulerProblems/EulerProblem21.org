* Problem
  Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
  If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

  For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

  Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

          self.f = f

          if not args in self.memo:

          return self.memo[args]

      for i in xrange(1, n):
          if n  % i == 0:
              t = t + i
      return t

  d = Memoize(dprime)


  t = []
  for i in range(1,10000):
      tmp1 = d(i)
      tmp2 = d(tmp1)

      if i == tmp1 and i == tmp2:
         continue
      elif i == tmp2:
          t.append(i)
          print i
