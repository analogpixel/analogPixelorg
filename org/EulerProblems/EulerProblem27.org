* Problem
  Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

  n² + n + 41

  It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

  The incredible formula  n² − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

  Considering quadratics of the form:

  n² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000

  where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
  e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4
  Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.

** Solution
   #+begin_src python
   import re

   max = - 1
   maxa = -1
   maxb = -1

   primes = []
   for a in open("primes.txt").read().split("\n"):
       a = a.strip()
       for n in re.split("\s+",a):
           if n != "":
               primes.append(int(n))




   def isPrime(x):
       if x in primes:
           return True
       else:
           return False

   for a in range(-1000, 1000):
       for b in range(-1000, 1000):
           n = 0
           run = 0
           while isPrime( (n * n)  + (a * n) + b):
               run = run + 1
               n = n + 1

           if run > max:
               max = run
               maxa = a
               maxb = b

   print max, maxa, maxb, maxa * maxb
