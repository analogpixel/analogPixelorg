* Problem
  2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

  What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

   for i in range(1,100000000):
       x = i * 20
       solution = True
       for a in range(19,1,-1):
           if (x % a) != 0:
               solution = False
               break

       if solution:
           print "solution:" , x

* Non Programming Solution
  Compute the prime factorization of each number from 1 to 20, and multiply the greatest power of each prime together:

  20 = 2 * 10 = 2 * 5 * 2
  19 = 19
  18 = 2 * 9 = 2 * 3 * 3
  17 = 17
  16 = 2 * 8 = 2 * 4 = 2 * 2 *2
  15 = 3 * 5
  14 = 2 * 7
  13 = 13
  11 = 11

  All others are included in the previous numbers.

  ANSWER: 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232 792 560
