* Problem
  If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

  If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?


  NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

  def count(str):
      return len(str.lower().replace(' ',''))

  def getNumber(n):

      ones = ["zero","one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten","eleven","twelve","thirteen",
           "fourteen","fifteen","sixteen","seventeen","eighteen","nineteen"]
      tens = [0,0,"twenty","thirty","forty","fifty","sixty","seventy","eighty","ninety"]

      if n < 20:
          return ones[n]
      if (n < 100) and (n%10 ==0):
          return tens[n/10]
      if n < 1000 and n % 100 == 0:
          a = n / 100
          return "%s hundred" % ones[a]
      if n < 100:
          a = n/10
          b = n % 10
          return "%s %s" % (tens[a] ,ones[b])
      if n < 1000:
          a = ones[n / 100]
          b = getNumber(n % 100)
          return "%s hundred and %s" %(a, b)

      if n == 1000:
          return "one thousand"



  if not getNumber(1) == "one":       print("failed one")

  if not getNumber(225) == "two hundred and twenty five":   print("failed two hundred twenty five")
  if not getNumber(1000) == "one thousand":   print("failed one thousand")

  if count("".join([getNumber(a) for a in range(1,6)])) != 19: print("failed 1..5")
  if count(getNumber(342)) != 23: print("Failed count 324")
  if count(getNumber(115)) != 20: print("Failed count 115")



  print getNumber(200)
  print count("".join([getNumber(a) for a in range(1,1001)]))
